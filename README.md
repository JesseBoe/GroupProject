# Tastes & Tunes

### Welcome to Tastes & Tunes!

Calling all entertainers! Tell us what type of food you're in the mood for an and add your dish name (this step is optional), and we'll generate a few recipies and a few playlists that might interest you.

Let us take the stress out of your get-together! Sit back and enjoy your themed playlists that you didn't even have to spend two hous making before hand. Our goal is to match you with some geographically correct recipies and playlists.

At minimum, you'll be able to tell us what kind of food you like (for example, Italian) and we'll generate a few recipies and playlists for you. We'd like to provide you with a drink, an appetizer, a dinner, and a dessert recipie, along with some tasty and suitable tunes.
